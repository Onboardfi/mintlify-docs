## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with your docs content. You can find this repository on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.onboardfi.com). To clone the repository locally, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a command line interface to render these changes locally.
    1. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally with this command:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is):
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.onboardfi.com). Once the bot has been successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.onboardfi.com).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
